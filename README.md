# ETL-Project Movie Madness


## Project Proposal
We going to look a 3 databases, 2 from IMBD and 1 from a rotten tomatoes ratings database. We will drop any unneeded columns, and load these 3 tables into SQL and join them on Movie ID /Director/Actor.

## Data Cleanup & Analysis
For the clean up process we imported the raw CSVs into pandas and dropped any unneeded columns from all the databases. From there, we created a schema using Postgres and imported the tables into SQL where we joined these databases on movie id/actor/director.
